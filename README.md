# Converting rmarkdown documents to anki flashcards (r2anki)

## Effectively Remember R-Skills through Spaced Repetition Learning
The `r2anki`-package offers an automated approach to bring notes from your favourite programming language (written in RMarkdown) to [Anki](https://ankisrs.net), a software for spaced repitition learning.

When you learn and use *R* you need to memorize important commands to solve programming tasks effectively. Unfortunately some less frequently used function calls can be forgot easily as you learn more about the language.

[Spaced repetition learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) offers a solution to this problem by exposing you only to learning content, that you are about to forget. The `r2anki`-package can be used to easily convert RMarkdown-scripts into a set of Anki-flashcards, that can be shared among the commmunity.
