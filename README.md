# Converting rmarkdown documents to anki flashcards (rmd2anki)

We are currently collecting ideas and scripts for the development and export of R-scripts to Anki in this repository.

Please have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/henningsway/rmd2anki/wiki) also.


- We love R
- We love open source and collaboration
- We think Anki is a great tool

Let's put all this together! :-)
