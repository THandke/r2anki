## card creation
- possible to have partner cards?
  (one for the TDVS and one for BASE?)
- would be nice, if the cards also worked without Anki-extensions (at least to use and read them, not necessariliy to create them)
- markup of cards should work in anki "night mode" also

## lessons learned
- tdvs and base on same card is too much info
